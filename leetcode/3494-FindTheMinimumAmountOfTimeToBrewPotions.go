// 3494. Find the Minimum Amount of Time to Brew Potions
// You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m, respectively.

// In a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order. 
// Each potion has a mana capacity mana[j] and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. 
// The time taken by the ith wizard on the jth potion is timeij = skill[i] * mana[j].

// Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. 
// This means the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives. â€‹

// Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.

// Example 1:
// Input: skill = [1,5,2,4], mana = [5,1,4,2]
// Output: 110
// Explanation:
// Potion Number | Start time | Wizard 0 done by | Wizard 1 done by | Wizard 2 done by | Wizard 3 done by
// 0                   0               5                   30                  40              60
// 1                   52              53                  58                  60              64
// 2                   54              58                  78                  86              102
// 3                   86              88                  98                  102             110
// As an example for why wizard 0 cannot start working on the 1st potion before time t = 52, consider the case where the wizards started preparing the 1st potion at time t = 50. At time t = 58, wizard 2 is done with the 1st potion, but wizard 3 will still be working on the 0th potion till time t = 60.

// Example 2:
// Input: skill = [1,1,1], mana = [1,1,1]
// Output: 5
// Explanation:
// Preparation of the 0th potion begins at time t = 0, and is completed by time t = 3.
// Preparation of the 1st potion begins at time t = 1, and is completed by time t = 4.
// Preparation of the 2nd potion begins at time t = 2, and is completed by time t = 5.

// Example 3:
// Input: skill = [1,2,3,4], mana = [1,2]
// Output: 21

// Constraints:
//     n == skill.length
//     m == mana.length
//     1 <= n, m <= 5000
//     1 <= mana[i], skill[i] <= 5000
