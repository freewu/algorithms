-- 613. Shortest Distance in a Line
-- Table: Point
--
-- +-------------+------+
-- | Column Name | Type |
-- +-------------+------+
-- | x           | int  |
-- +-------------+------+
-- x is the primary key column for this table.
-- Each row of this table indicates the position of a point on the X-axis.
-- Â 
-- Write an SQL query to report the shortest distance between any two points from the Point table.
-- The query result format is in the following example.
-- Example 1:
--
-- Input:
-- Point table:
-- +----+
-- | x  |
-- +----+
-- | -1 |
-- | 0  |
-- | 2  |
-- +----+
-- Output:
-- +----------+
-- | shortest |
-- +----------+
-- | 1        |
-- +----------+
-- Explanation: The shortest distance is between points -1 and 0 which is |(-1) - 0| = 1.
-- Follow up: How could you optimize your query if the Point table is ordered in ascending order?

-- Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    MIN(abs(a.x - b.x)) AS shortest
FROM
    `point` AS a,
    `point` AS b
WHERE
    a.x != b.x
