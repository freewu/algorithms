// 4025. Minimize the Maximum Waiting Time at Synchronized Traffic Lights
// You are given an integer period and an integer array lights, where lights[i] is the duration, in seconds, of the green phase of the ith traffic light.

// At time 0, every traffic light starts at the beginning of its green phase. 
// Their cycles are synchronized: every traffic light starts a new cycle at the same time, and every cycle lasts exactly period seconds. 
// Therefore, the red phase of the ith traffic light lasts for period - lights[i] seconds.

// You are also given an integer array arrivalTime, where arrivalTime[j] is the arrival time, in seconds, of the jth car.

// Each car must be assigned to exactly one traffic light. Multiple cars may be assigned to the same traffic light. 
// Any number of cars may cross the same traffic light simultaneously while it is green. 
// Cars do not block or delay one another.

// For a car j assigned to the ith traffic light, let r = arrivalTime[j] % period. 
// If r < lights[i], its waiting time is 0. Otherwise, its waiting time is period - r.

// The penalty of an assignment is the maximum waiting time among all cars.

// Return an integer denoting the minimum possible penalty.

// Example 1:
// Input: period = 8, lights = [2,3], arrivalTime = [2,5,8,11]
// Output: 5
// Explanation:
// One optimal solution is:
// Assign arrivalTime[0] to the traffic light with lights[1] = 3. Here, r = 2 % 8 = 2. Since 2 < 3, the waiting time is 0.
// Assign arrivalTime[1] to the traffic light with lights[0] = 2. Here, r = 5 % 8 = 5. Since 5 >= 2, the waiting time is 8 - 5 = 3.
// Assign arrivalTime[2] to the traffic light with lights[0] = 2. Here, r = 8 % 8 = 0. Since 0 < 2, the waiting time is 0.
// Assign arrivalTime[3] to the traffic light with lights[0] = 2. Here, r = 11 % 8 = 3. Since 3 >= 2, the waiting time is 8 - 3 = 5.
// The penalty of this assignment is 5, which is the minimum possible. Other optimal assignments may exist.

// Example 2:
// Input: period = 10, lights = [3,6,8], arrivalTime = [4,9,15]
// Output: 1
// Explanation:
// One optimal solution is:
// Assign arrivalTime[0] to the traffic light with lights[2] = 8. Here, r = 4 % 10 = 4. Since 4 < 8, the waiting time is 0.
// Assign arrivalTime[1] to the traffic light with lights[2] = 8. Here, r = 9 % 10 = 9. Since 9 >= 8, the waiting time is 10 - 9 = 1.
// Assign arrivalTime[2] to the traffic light with lights[2] = 8. Here, r = 15 % 10 = 5. Since 5 < 8, the waiting time is 0.
// The penalty of this assignment is 1, which is the minimum possible.

// Example 3:
// Input: period = 5, lights = [2], arrivalTime = [2,3,4,5,6]
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// One optimal solution is:
// Assign arrivalTime[0] to the traffic light with lights[0] = 2. Here, r = 2 % 5 = 2. Since 2 >= 2, the waiting time is 5 - 2 = 3.
// Assign arrivalTime[1] to the traffic light with lights[0] = 2. Here, r = 3 % 5 = 3. Since 3 >= 2, the waiting time is 5 - 3 = 2.
// Assign arrivalTime[2] to the traffic light with lights[0] = 2. Here, r = 4 % 5 = 4. Since 4 >= 2, the waiting time is 5 - 4 = 1.
// Assign arrivalTime[3] to the traffic light with lights[0] = 2. Here, r = 5 % 5 = 0. Since 0 < 2, the waiting time is 0.
// Assign arrivalTime[4] to the traffic light with lights[0] = 2. Here, r = 6 % 5 = 1. Since 1 < 2, the waiting time is 0.
// The penalty of this assignment is 3, which is the minimum possible.

// Constraints:
//     2 <= period <= 10^9
//     1 <= lights.length <= 10^4
//     1 <= lights[i] <= period - 1
//     1 <= arrivalTime.length <= 10^5
//     1 <= arrivalTime[i] <= 10^9
