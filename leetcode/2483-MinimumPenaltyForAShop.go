// 2483. Minimum Penalty for a Shop
// You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a 0-indexed string customers consisting only of characters 'N' and 'Y':
//     1. if the ith character is 'Y', it means that customers come at the ith hour
//     2. whereas 'N' indicates that no customers come at the ith hour.

// If the shop closes at the jth hour (0 <= j <= n), the penalty is calculated as follows:
//     1. For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty increases by 1.
//     2. For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty increases by 1.

// Return the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a minimum penalty.

// Note that if a shop closes at the jth hour, it means the shop is closed at the hour j.

// Example 1:
// Input: customers = "YYNY"
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 
// - Closing the shop at the 0th hour incurs in 1+1+0+1 = 3 penalty.
// - Closing the shop at the 1st hour incurs in 0+1+0+1 = 2 penalty.
// - Closing the shop at the 2nd hour incurs in 0+0+0+1 = 1 penalty.
// - Closing the shop at the 3rd hour incurs in 0+0+1+1 = 2 penalty.
// - Closing the shop at the 4th hour incurs in 0+0+1+0 = 1 penalty.
// Closing the shop at 2nd or 4th hour gives a minimum penalty. Since 2 is earlier, the optimal closing time is 2.

// Example 2:
// Input: customers = "NNNNN"
// Output: 0
// Explanation: It is best to close the shop at the 0th hour as no customers arrive.

// Example 3:
// Input: customers = "YYYY"
// Output: 4
// Explanation: It is best to close the shop at the 4th hour as customers arrive at each hour.

// Constraints:
//     1 <= customers.length <= 10^5
//     customers consists only of characters 'Y' and 'N'.
