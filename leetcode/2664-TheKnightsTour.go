// 2664. The Knightâ€™s Tour
// Given two positive integers m and n which are the height and width of a 0-indexed 2D-array board, 
// a pair of positive integers (r, c) which is the starting position of the knight on the board.

// Your task is to find an order of movements for the knight, in a manner 
// that every cell of the board gets visited exactly once (the starting cell is considered visited 
// and you shouldn't visit it again).

// Return the array board in which the cells' values show the order of visiting the cell starting from 0 
// (the initial place of the knight).

// Note that a knight can move from cell (r1, c1) to cell (r2, c2) if 0 <= r2 <= m - 1 and 0 <= c2 <= n - 1 
// and min(abs(r1 - r2), abs(c1 - c2)) = 1 and max(abs(r1 - r2), abs(c1 - c2)) = 2.

// Example 1:
// Input: m = 1, n = 1, r = 0, c = 0
// Output: [[0]]
// Explanation: There is only 1 cell and the knight is initially on it so there is only a 0 inside the 1x1 grid.

// Example 2:
// Input: m = 3, n = 4, r = 0, c = 0
// Output: [[0,3,6,9],[11,8,1,4],[2,5,10,7]]
// Explanation: By the following order of movements we can visit the entire board.
// (0,0)->(1,2)->(2,0)->(0,1)->(1,3)->(2,1)->(0,2)->(2,3)->(1,1)->(0,3)->(2,2)->(1,0)

// Constraints:
//     1 <= m, n <= 5
//     0 <= r <= m - 1
//     0 <= c <= n - 1
//     The inputs will be generated such that there exists at least one possible order of movements with the given condition
