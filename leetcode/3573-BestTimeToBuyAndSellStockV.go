// 3573. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock V
// You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a stock in dollars on the ith day, and an integer k.

// You are allowed to make at most k transactions, where each transaction can be either of the following:

// Normal transaction: Buy on day i, then sell on a later day j where i < j. You profit prices[j] - prices[i].

// Short selling transaction: Sell on day i, then buy back on a later day j where i < j. You profit prices[i] - prices[j].

// Note that you must complete each transaction before starting another. 
// Additionally, you can't buy or sell on the same day you are selling or buying back as part of a previous transaction.

// Return the maximum total profit you can earn by making at most k transactions.

// Example 1:
// Input: prices = [1,7,9,8,2], k = 2
// Output: 14
// Explanation:
// We can make $14 of profit through 2 transactions:
// A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 0 for $1 then sell it on day 2 for $9.
// A short selling transaction: sell the stock on day 3 for $8 then buy back on day 4 for $2.

// Example 2:
// Input: prices = [12,16,19,19,8,1,19,13,9], k = 3
// Output: 36
// Explanation:
// We can make $36 of profit through 3 transactions:
// A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 0 for $12 then sell it on day 2 for $19.
// A short selling transaction: sell the stock on day 3 for $19 then buy back on day 4 for $8.
// A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 5 for $1 then sell it on day 6 for $19.

// Constraints:
//     2 <= prices.length <= 10^3
//     1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9
//     1 <= k <= prices.length / 2
