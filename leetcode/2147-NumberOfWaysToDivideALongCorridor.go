// 2147. Number of Ways to Divide a Long Corridor
// Along a long library corridor, there is a line of seats and decorative plants. 
// You are given a 0-indexed string corridor of length n consisting of letters 'S' and 'P' where each 'S' represents a seat and each 'P' represents a plant.

// One room divider has already been installed to the left of index 0, and another to the right of index n - 1. 
// Additional room dividers can be installed. 
// For each position between indices i - 1 and i (1 <= i <= n - 1), at most one divider can be installed.

// Divide the corridor into non-overlapping sections, where each section has exactly two seats with any number of plants. 
// There may be multiple ways to perform the division. 
// Two ways are different if there is a position with a room divider installed in the first way but not in the second way.

// Return the number of ways to divide the corridor. 
// Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7. If there is no way, return 0.

// Example 1:
// <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/04/1.png" />
// Input: corridor = "SSPPSPS"
// Output: 3
// Explanation: There are 3 different ways to divide the corridor.
// The black bars in the above image indicate the two room dividers already installed.
// Note that in each of the ways, each section has exactly two seats.

// Example 2:
// <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/04/2.png" />
// Input: corridor = "PPSPSP"
// Output: 1
// Explanation: There is only 1 way to divide the corridor, by not installing any additional dividers.
// Installing any would create some section that does not have exactly two seats.

// Example 3:
// <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/12/3.png" />
// Input: corridor = "S"
// Output: 0
// Explanation: There is no way to divide the corridor because there will always be a section that does not have exactly two seats.

// Constraints:
//     n == corridor.length
//     1 <= n <= 10^5
//     corridor[i] is either 'S' or 'P'.
