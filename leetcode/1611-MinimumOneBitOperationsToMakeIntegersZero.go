// 1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero
// Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:
//     1. Change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of n.
//     2. Change the ith bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.

// Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.

// Example 1:
// Input: n = 3
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".
// "11" -> "01" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
// "01" -> "00" with the 1st operation.

// Example 2:
// Input: n = 6
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is "110".
// "110" -> "010" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.
// "010" -> "011" with the 1st operation.
// "011" -> "001" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
// "001" -> "000" with the 1st operation.

// Constraints:
//     0 <= n <= 10^9
