-- 2253. Dynamic Unpivoting of a Table
-- Table: Products
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | product_id  | int     |
-- | store_name1 | int     |
-- | store_name2 | int     |
-- |      :      | int     |
-- |      :      | int     |
-- |      :      | int     |
-- | store_namen | int     |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- product_id is the primary key for this table.
-- Each row in this table indicates the product's price in n different stores.
-- If the product is not available in a store, the price will be null in that store's column.
-- The names of the stores may change from one testcase to another. There will be at least 1 store and at most 30 stores.
 
-- Important note: This problem targets those who have a good experience with SQL. If you are a beginner, we recommend that you skip it for now.
-- Implement the procedure UnpivotProducts to reorganize the Products table so that each row has the id of one product, the name of a store where it is sold, and its price in that store. If a product is not available in a store, do not include a row with that product_id and store combination in the result table. There should be three columns: product_id, store, and price.
-- The procedure should return the table after reorganizing it.

-- Return the result table in any order.
-- The query result format is in the following example.

-- Example 1:
-- Input: 
-- Products table:
-- +------------+----------+--------+------+------+
-- | product_id | LC_Store | Nozama | Shop | Souq |
-- +------------+----------+--------+------+------+
-- | 1          | 100      | null   | 110  | null |
-- | 2          | null     | 200    | null | 190  |
-- | 3          | null     | null   | 1000 | 1900 |
-- +------------+----------+--------+------+------+
-- Output: 
-- +------------+----------+-------+
-- | product_id | store    | price |
-- +------------+----------+-------+
-- | 1          | LC_Store | 100   |
-- | 1          | Shop     | 110   |
-- | 2          | Nozama   | 200   |
-- | 2          | Souq     | 190   |
-- | 3          | Shop     | 1000  |
-- | 3          | Souq     | 1900  |
-- +------------+----------+-------+
-- Explanation: 
-- Product 1 is sold in LC_Store and Shop with prices of 100 and 110 respectively.
-- Product 2 is sold in Nozama and Souq with prices of 200 and 190.
-- Product 3 is sold in Shop and Souq with prices of 1000 and 1900.

-- Truncate table Products
-- insert into Products (product_id, LC_Store, Nozama, Shop, Souq) values ('1', '100', 'None', '110', 'None')
-- insert into Products (product_id, LC_Store, Nozama, Shop, Souq) values ('2', 'None', '200', 'None', '190')
-- insert into Products (product_id, LC_Store, Nozama, Shop, Souq) values ('3', 'None', 'None', '1000', '1900')
