// 2141. Maximum Running Time of N Computers
// You have n computers. 
// You are given the integer n and a 0-indexed integer array batteries where the ith battery can run a computer for batteries[i] minutes. 
// You are interested in running all n computers simultaneously using the given batteries.

// Initially, you can insert at most one battery into each computer. 
// After that and at any integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery any number of times. 
// The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. 
// You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.

// Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.

// Return the maximum number of minutes you can run all the n computers simultaneously.

// Example 1:
// <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/06/example1-fit.png" />
// Input: n = 2, batteries = [3,3,3]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: 
// Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 1 into the second computer.
// After two minutes, remove battery 1 from the second computer and insert battery 2 instead. Note that battery 1 can still run for one minute.
// At the end of the third minute, battery 0 is drained, and you need to remove it from the first computer and insert battery 1 instead.
// By the end of the fourth minute, battery 1 is also drained, and the first computer is no longer running.
// We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 4 minutes, so we return 4.

// Example 2:
// <img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/01/06/example2.png" />
// Input: n = 2, batteries = [1,1,1,1]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 
// Initially, insert battery 0 into the first computer and battery 2 into the second computer. 
// After one minute, battery 0 and battery 2 are drained so you need to remove them and insert battery 1 into the first computer and battery 3 into the second computer. 
// After another minute, battery 1 and battery 3 are also drained so the first and second computers are no longer running.
// We can run the two computers simultaneously for at most 2 minutes, so we return 2.

// Constraints:
//     1 <= n <= batteries.length <= 10^5
//     1 <= batteries[i] <= 10^9
