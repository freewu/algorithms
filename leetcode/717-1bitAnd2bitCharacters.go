// 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
// We have two special characters:
//     The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
//     The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

// Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.

// Example 1:
// Input: bits = [1,0,0]
// Output: true
// Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.
// So the last character is one-bit character.

// Example 2:
// Input: bits = [1,1,1,0]
// Output: false
// Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character.
// So the last character is not one-bit character.

// Constraints:
//     1 <= bits.length <= 1000
//     bits[i] is either 0 or 1.
