/**
455 Â· Student ID

# Description
Implement a class Class with the following attributes and methods:

A public attribute students which is a array of Student instances.
A constructor with a parameter n, which is the total number of students in this class. 
The constructor should create n Student instances and initialized with student id from 0 ~ n-1

Example 1:

    Input: 3
    Output: [0, 1, 2]
    Explanation: For 3 students, your cls.students[0] should equal to 0,
    cls.students[1] should equal to 1 and the cls.students[2] should equal to 2.

Example 2:

    Input: 5
    Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
