# 2178 Â· Iterators and Fibonacci series
# Description
# In this problem we need to customize an iterator to generate Fibonacci series,
# we have already written the code to set two initial values and return the iterator itself in solution.py for you, 
# and you don't need to instantiate the class or call the method, we have already written in main.py.
# you just need to fill in the rest of the __next__() 
# You just need to fill in the rest of the code in __next__() to implement the accumulation and assignment of initial values , 
# and the evaluator will automatically form a set of Fibonacci series with your return value as the right boundary.


# Pay attention to the indentation between classes and methods
# Pay attention to Chinese and English punctuation issues
# Example
# The evaluator will run your code by executing the command python main.py <num>.
# Passing num as a command line argument, num is the length of the Fibonacci sequence, 
# and you can see how the code works in main.py. 
# Your code should output different results for different nums.

# When executing python main.py 8, your code should output:

# [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
# When executing python main.py 0, your code should output.
