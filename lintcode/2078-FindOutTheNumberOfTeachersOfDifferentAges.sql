-- 2078 Â· Find out the number of teachers of different ages
-- # Description
-- Write an SQL statement that queries the teachers table for the number of teachers of different ages 
-- and sorts the results in descending order of age, returning the column name as age_count.

-- Table definition: teachers (Teachers table)

-- Column Name	Type	Comments
-- id	int unsigned	primary key
-- name	varchar	teacher's name
-- email	varchar	teacher's email
-- age	int	teacher's age
-- country	varchar	teacher's nationality

-- The query needs to return the same column names as the sample output.

-- 4	Southern Emperor	southern.emperor@qq.com	21	JP
