-- 2086 Â· Search for the nationality of the teacher starting with 'U' and the total number of students between 2000 and 5000 and the total number of students of that nationality
-- # Description
-- Write an SQL statement to count the total number of students of courses offered by teachers from different country by linking the courses and teachers tables, 
-- and count the total number of students as 0 for teachers teach nothing.

-- Finally, query the nationality of teachers whose nationality begins with 'U' 
-- and the total number of students (alias student_count) of all teachers of this nationality is between 2000 and 5000 (Include 2000 and 5000), 
-- then sort the results in descending order by the total number of students, or in ascending order by the teacher's nationality if the total number of students is the same.

-- Table Definition 1: courses

-- column name	type	comment
-- id	int unsigned	primary key
-- name	varchar	course name
-- student_count	int	total students
-- created_at	date	creation time
-- teacher_id	int	instructor id
-- Table Definition 2: teachers

-- column_name	type	comment
-- id	int unsigned	primary key
-- name	varchar	teacher's name
-- email	varchar	teacher's email
-- age	int	teacher's age
-- country	varchar	teacher's nationality

-- The column name returned by the query needs to be the same as the case of the column name output by the sample.
-- If there is a NULL value for the total number of students in the input data, you need to set the total number of students to 0.
-- If the query does not return any results, nothing will be returned.

-- country	student_count
-- Because the data of student_count in the input sample are all NULL, 
-- the total number of students is counted as 0, but the filtering condition is not satisfied, so only the title is shown here, no data.
