-- 2080 Â· Search for the name of the instructor and the total number of students in all the instructor's courses with less than 3000 students
-- # Description
-- Write an SQL statement that join the courses and teachers tables to count the total number of students of courses offered by same teacher, 
-- and count the total number of students as 0 for teachers teach nothing.
-- Finally, query the names of teachers and the total number of students (alias student_count) with total students fewer than 3000. 
-- Sort the results in ascending order by the total number of students or, if the total number of students were the same, by the teacher's name.

-- Table definition 1: courses

-- column name	type	comment
-- id	int unsigned	primary key
-- name	varchar	course name
-- student_count	int	total students
-- created_at	date	creation time
-- teacher_id	int	teacher id
-- Table Definition 2: teachers

-- column_name	type	comment
-- id	int unsigned	primary key
-- name	varchar	teacher's name
-- email	varchar	teacher's email
-- age	int	teacher's age
-- country	varchar	teacher's nationality

-- The column name returned by the query needs to be the same as the case of the column name output by the sample.
-- If the teacher taught nothing, or if there is a NULL value in the input data, you need to set the total number of students to 0.
