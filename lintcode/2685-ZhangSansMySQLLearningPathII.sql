-- 2685 Â· Zhang San's MySQL Learning Path (II)
-- #  Description
-- Zhang San once had a dream to listen to every teacher's course in the school, 
-- so he wrote a view v_mydream to show all the courses with the information of the teachers, 
-- and go in ascending order by teacher's name to achieve, but Zhang San found that there are too many courses, 
-- the dream needs to be changed, 
-- so he changed his dream to listen to each teacher's most popular course (the more students listening to the course If the teacher does not teach a course, 
-- the number of courses and students will be displayed as NULL) 
-- The school was very supportive and heard that he was recently learning MySQL and gave him 2 tables of data to find out for himself, 
-- the teachers table contains information about teachers and the courses table contains information about courses.
-- Zhang San looks at it and says, "Wow, this is too easy, thanks to the school for providing the data",
--  but he is about to rewrite the original dream view when he finds Li Si passing by. 
-- Li Si hungry croak, see Zhang San asked to go to dinner together, Zhang San a flash of light, "
-- so coincidentally ~ I also intend to go to dinner, but now I have a very simple problem here, you help me solve I will buy you dinner ",
-- Li Si heard that there is such a good thing, immediately agreed to down, 
-- and found that it will not. In order not to lose face and to be able to eat a meal, 
-- he secretly contacted you and asked you to help him solve it.
